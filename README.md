# Voting-System
 Solidity smart contract named  VotingSystem that implements a basic voting  mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain.


The contract allows an admin (the contract deployer) to initialize a list of candidates. Any Ethereum address can cast a vote for one of the candidates. However, a voter can vote only once, and each vote is counted in real-time. The contract also provides functionality to determine the winning candidate based on the highest number of votes.

 Objective:
 · Set up a Hardhat project
 · Deploy a Solidity contract
 ·  Debug using console.log()
 · Write and run Hardhat tests
 ·  Push the project to GitHub
